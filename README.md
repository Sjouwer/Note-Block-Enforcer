# Note Block Enforcer (1.14.4)
This is a plugin to aid with special texture packs that use note block BlockStates to add a lot of extra textures to Minecraft. The plugin does the following:  
- Enforces the Item NBT BlockState when a Note Block is being placed down
- Stops any neighbor updates from changing the note block BlockStates
- Removes the ability to change the note of a note block with a right click, instead it allows for placing a block
